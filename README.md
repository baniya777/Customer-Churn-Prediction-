# Customer Churn Prediction
Predict customer churn using machine learning models on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used is [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) from Kaggle. It contains customer demographics, account information, and service usage details.

## Overview
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with encoding and scaling
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Evaluation with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix heatmaps
- Feature importance visualization for Random Forest and XGBoost

## Usage
1. Download the dataset `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` from Kaggle
2. Run the script or notebook with Python 3.x
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost

## Results
XGBoost showed the best performance. Confusion matrices and feature importance plots provide model insights.
